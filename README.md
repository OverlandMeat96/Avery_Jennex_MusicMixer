# Vaporwave Music Mixer

This is the Git Repo for our vaporwave themed music mixer project. The vaporwave theme is focused on the 80's style of neon lights and bright colors and also has a heavy muscle car view. This theme can be seen in many different racing video games such as "Far Cry:Blood Dragon" and "OutDrive". Our music samples will be split into four different categories; bass, percussion, high synth, and low synth.
